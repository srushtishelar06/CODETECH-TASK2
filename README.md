 PROJECT: Student Grade Calculator![students grade tracker output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d13ec4bf-cf98-4b64-982a-97f7651e56bb)

 
#### **Objective**:
This **Student Grade Calculator** program is designed to calculate a student's GPA based on the letter grades provided for each subject. It converts letter grades into a numeric GPA, computes an average, and determines an overall letter grade equivalent.

#### **Key Activities**:
The program allows the user to enter subject names and corresponding letter grades. It converts each letter grade to a numeric value, calculates the GPA, and provides an average grade along with an equivalent letter grade summary.

#### **Technologies Used**:
- **Python Programming Language**: Provides a clean syntax and built-in functions for calculations.
- **Conditional Statements**: Used in `letter_to_grade` to assign numeric values based on letter grades.
- **Looping and Input Handling**: Gathers subject and grade inputs, processes them, and handles any invalid entries.
  
#### **Key Insights**:
- **Error Handling**: The program checks for valid letter grades and prompts the user if an invalid grade is entered.
- **Grade Conversion**: Converts letter grades to numeric values for GPA calculation, providing students with both GPA and letter grade insights.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: With prompts and a summary report, the program is accessible and easy to use for students managing multiple subjects.

This program demonstrates key programming concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, and user input, making it a useful tool for learning and GPA calculation.
